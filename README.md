#POV & INSPIRATION
The main inspirations for our app were Google Trips and TripAdvisor. Although we liked Google Trip’s UI and design choices, we heard that many users didn’t enjoy using it. On the other hand, we liked a lot of the features in the TripAdvisor app but wanted to keep our app simple and focus on finding things to do. During the last few weeks, our group learned a lot more about how we wanted people to use our app and what we wanted to focus on developing.
